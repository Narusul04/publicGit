# Universe Database

This repository contains the `universe.sql` file, which is part of a freeCodeCamp project. The data within this file is practically made up and intended for portfolio purposes only.

## Project Overview

The `universe.sql` file is a SQL script that creates and populates a database with information about galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and constellations. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in SQL database design and manipulation.
